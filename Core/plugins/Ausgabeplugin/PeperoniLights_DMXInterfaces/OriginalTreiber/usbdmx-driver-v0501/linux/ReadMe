This driver and source code for test applications is provided as is.
In case of trouble contact driver@lighting-solutions.de.

The Makefile now contains to sections to build the driver for either
kernel 2.4.x or 2.6.x. The build for kernel 2.4 is done using the target
k24 while for kernel 2.6.x the target k26 has to be used. In addition to the
two build targets two clean targets (clean24 and clean26) are provided.
Please note that no module is build by default anymore. Please use the
proper target.

INSTALL:
> make [k24|k26]
> make 

which should compile you the driver (usbdmx.o/usbdmx.ko) and demo code.
The driver uses major 180, minor 192+. To create the devices used to
access the interfaces, type as root:

> mknod -m a=rw /dev/usbdmx0 c 180 192
> mknod -m a=rw /dev/usbdmx1 c 180 193
> mknod -m a=rw /dev/usbdmx2 c 180 194
> mknod -m a=rw /dev/usbdmx3 c 180 195
...

The driver supports up to 16 devices in the moment.
To use the driver load it via 

> insmod [usbdmx.o|usbdmx.ko]

USAGE:
For usage information consult the demo source code demo.c and the include
file "usbdmx.h".
