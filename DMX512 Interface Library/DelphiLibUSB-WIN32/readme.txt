This is a translation of the libusb-win32 headers to delphi.
Because delphi cannot use ".lib" files generated by C(++) compilers.
I've compiled the libusb.lib into a DLL which can be accessed in delphi.
The usb.h header is translated into a delphi header which links to 
this DLL (USBLibExport.dll).
There is a test program to see if it works.
You ofcourse need the LibUSB driver installed to get it to work correctly.
